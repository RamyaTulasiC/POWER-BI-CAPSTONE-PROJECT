## Insights
  
Focused Attention on the USA Market:

Given that the USA emerges as the top-selling country for Axon cars, it's crucial for the company to prioritize and allocate resources to enhance sales and service efficiency in this market. 



Optimize Stock of Classic Cars:

Since the analysis highlights that the most selling products are from the "Classic Cars" category, Axon should prioritize maintaining a proper and timely stock of vintage cars to meet customer demand. 

Weekend Sales :

Weekends, particularly Saturdays and Sundays, exhibit lower sales volumes based on the car analysis. To optimize this, Axon should implement targeted strategies such as weekend-exclusive deals, extended test drive opportunities, proactive customer engagement, and specialized training for staff to enhance sales performance during these periods.



Monthly Sales : 

The company achieves its peak sales in November, making it the highest performing month. Conversely, September records the lowest sales volume for the company. Company Should create some offers during the month of September in order to attract customers and increase the sales.
